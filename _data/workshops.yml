We’ll connect these concepts to real decisions: capability vs cost, latency vs quality, context length vs reliability, and parameter count vs “felt” performance. We’ll also demystify evaluation: what benchmark scores do and don’t tell you, how to spot mismatched evals (chat vs base, tool-use vs no tool-use), and how to run quick, task-relevant checks using input→output behavior.

  category: ai
  level: introductory
  description: This workshop introduces researchers to using AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude to create computational tools through natural language conversation.

  prerequisites: []
  duration: 90 minutes
  full_description: <p>This workshop introduces researchers to using AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude to create computational tools through natural language conversation rather than traditional programming. This workshop covers how to effectively communicate what you want to accomplish (the &quot;vibe&quot;) to get AI to generate working code for data analysis, visualization, and research automation. You&#39;ll learn practical strategies for prompting AI tools, iterating on solutions, and validating outputs, plus explore different AI coding assistants from chat interfaces to autonomous coding agents. By the end, you&#39;ll be able to direct AI to help with common research computing tasks—from statistical analyses to data processing scripts—without needing to write code yourself.</p>
